# What's special about Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at Carnegie Mellon University?

## User Studies Lab [🔗](http://coexlab.com/#facilities)
The Connected Experience lab is a research group within the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University addressing social, technical, and policy issues emerging around new forms of technology supported work, communication and creative collaboration. The CoEx lab is made up of postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students passionate about understanding and designing for the challenges people face working and participating in a highly connected, data-driven society."


## Design Facilities: D-Form Studio [🔗](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/facilities)
The HCII's revolutionary D-Form Studio design space came online in January, 2013. This space, on South Craig Street adjacent to the MHCI space, contains a large studio classroom, exhibition space, a prototyping lab, and an instrumented home lab. The classroom revolutionizes how we teach design courses by allowing lecture or critique to occur in small sections or a large, contiguous space. The exhibition space hosts demonstrations, shows, workshops, and social gatherings. The prototyping lab is available for cutting, sanding, and assembling paper and wood, and for designing and creating 3D printed pieces. The instrumented home lab allows users to prototype and study how people and technology exist in domestic spaces.

## DevLab Physical Prototyping Laboratory
The DevLab provides facilities and equipment supporting rapid prototyping of interactive devices and systems. It serves as a departmental resource for faculty, students, and staff interested in building physical prototypes, small custom electronic components, and other devices and systems for advanced interactive concepts.  The laboratory provides tools such as 3D printers and laser cutters, fabrication space, and materials to facilitate construction of small-scale prototypes.


## Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center[🔗](https://learnlab.org/)
The Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center is a National Science Foundation Center housed jointly at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. This center provides a national resource called LearnLab courses for researchers to investigate mathematics, science and language arts. As part of the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center (PSLC), the current project has access to the LearnLab, an international resource that provides a number of assets for learning scientists (PSLC, 2005).
