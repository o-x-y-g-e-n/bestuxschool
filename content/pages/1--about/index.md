### Motivation
I have been searching for UX Schools myself for Fall 2021. I have been lucky enough to have gathered a lot of information regarding different universities. 

> But when I look around at top blogs, I realized that none of them gave a comparative picture of different universities. I mean we all struggle with the question right, "Why this university?" and that's what we are asked to write in personal statement.

Hence I took the liberty to deep dive into their websiites, look at different offerings. Ranks mentioned at different websites like
* *topuxschool.com* [ðŸ”—](https://topuxschool.com/)
* *usertesting.com* [ðŸ”—](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/top-ux-graduate-degree-programs)
* *valuecolleges.com* [ðŸ”—](https://www.valuecolleges.com/rankings/best-ux-design-graduate-programs/)

do matter, but to a certain limit. You have to deep dive into the research, curriculum, fees, alumni, research topics, facilities, networking opportunities, housing facilities and so much more while deciding for a university.

Use this blog as a context to that. I have extracted the information that is enough for you to atleast getting started with your search. I have created a simple path / pattern for you to surf around so that you are synced with information in similar structure.

All the information here has been taken from the official websites unless mentioned otherwise.
