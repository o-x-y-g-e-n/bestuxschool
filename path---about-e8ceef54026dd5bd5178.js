I have been lucky enough to have gathered a lot of information regarding different universities. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But when I look around at top blogs, I realized that none of them gave a comparative picture of different universities. I mean we all struggle with the question right, “Why this university?” and that’s what we are asked to write in personal statement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hence I took the liberty to deep dive into their websiites, look at different offerings. Ranks mentioned at different websites like</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>topuxschool.com</em> <a href="https://topuxschool.com/">🔗</a></li>\n<li><em>usertesting.com</em> <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/blog/top-ux-graduate-degree-programs">🔗</a></li>\n<li><em>valuecolleges.com</em> <a href="https://www.valuecolleges.com/rankings/best-ux-design-graduate-programs/">🔗</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>do matter, but to a certain limit. You have to deep dive into the research, curriculum, fees, alumni, research topics, facilities, networking opportunities, housing facilities and so much more while deciding for a university.</p>\n<p>Use this blog as a context to that. I have extracted the information that is enough for you to atleast getting started with your search. I have created a simple path / pattern for you to surf around so that you are synced with information in similar structure.</p>\n<p>All the information here has been taken from the official websites unless mentioned otherwise.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"About"}},footnote:{id:"/home/shivam/Documents/gatsby-starter-personal-blog-master/content/parts/footnote.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",html:""},site:{siteMetadata:{facebook:{appId:""}}}},pathContext:{slug:"/about/"}}}});
