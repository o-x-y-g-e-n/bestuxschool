# What's special about Master of Human-Centered Design - Florida Tech?

## Specializations 
Studying for a master's degree in human-centered design from Florida Institute of Technology is an interdisciplinary experience that covers other academic disciplines ranging from human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence to architecture, ethnographic design, and crisis management. Human-centered design, innovation and art also provide courses on creativity and design thinking, functional analysis, industrial design and user experience.

## Human-Centered Design Institute [üîó](https://research.fit.edu/human-centered-design-institute/)
The Human-Centered Design Institute (HCDi) develops education and research in various domains such as aeronautics, space, energy production and management, health care, and education. We have research and innovation labs, such as the commercial aviation cockpit design lab (equipped with A320 and B737 fully equipped flight deck simulators) and 3D-moving spaceship simulator. We also have an advanced interaction research lab where various kinds of novel tangible interactive systems can be designed and tested. 

## ATLAS Lab [üîó](https://research.fit.edu/atlas/)
The ATLAS lab studies how individuals make decisions under stress and uncertainty.  This includes utilizing physiological measures to assess stress and workload, in hand with granular process-level measures of decision making and performance.  It has also resulted in development of a framework of factors which influence how individuals make decisions with conflicting information.
