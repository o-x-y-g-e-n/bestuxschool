# What's special about Master of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) - Rochester Institute of Technology

## Co-op [üîó](https://www.rit.edu/cooperative-education)
There‚Äôs a classic conundrum that recent college graduates have to untangle: Employers want candidates who have work experience. But how do you get experience without a job?
That‚Äôs easy. Get a co-op.

## Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research [üîó](cair.rit.edu)
The Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research (CAIR) brings together faculty and students who conduct and publish research at leading computing and education venues on accessibility and assistive technology for diverse users, including people who are deaf or hard of hearing, people who are blind, people with communication impairments, and older adults.


## Center for Human-aware AI (CHAI) [üîó](https://www.rit.edu/chai/)
To improve the quality of human life with breakthrough research in AI and to comprehensively equip future AI practitioners and scientists.

## HCI Research [üîó](http://hci-research.rit.edu/)
Faculty and students at RIT are conducting research in several areas of human computer interaction, including accessibility and inclusion, eye-tracking and visual perception, human-aware artificial intelligence, wearable and mobile computing, educational technology, consumer behavior, and usable security. This website is a hub for information across RIT. 

## Linguistic and Assistive Technologies Laboratory [üîó](http://latlab.ist.rit.edu/)

## Project Option 
A capstone project is a large body of work, which you undertake independently under the supervision of a full-time IST faculty member. A Project consists of a nontrivial design project, software or web development project, and/or software or web deployment project and a detailed report discussing it; a capstone project may also consist of a research project that investigates more theoretical questions ‚Äì along with a report that describes the research and results.  For the Project option, original insight into a problem is desirable but not required.  The project report is expected to be in the form of a scientific paper:  

‚Ä¢ describing background and relevant results in the area  
‚Ä¢ detailing the work carried out  
‚Ä¢ discussing the significance of the deliverables of the endeavor and providing appropriate reference citations 

## Thesis Option 
As compared to a Project, a Thesis deals with a research question and involves a master‚Äôs level of original insight. The expectations for background research and justification are much higher for a Thesis, as compared to a Project.  It is expected that the quality of research produced in a Thesis would be suitable for submission as a research paper to a conference, a journal, or other form of public dissemination, and in general, students who are pursuing a Thesis option are expected to submit their research to such venues.  More specifically, the difference between a project and thesis is the nature of the work involved.
