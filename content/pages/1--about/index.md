#####  WHY BESTUXSCHOOL?
![bestuxschool](bestuxschool.png)
I have been searching for UX Schools myself for Fall 2021. I have been lucky enough to have gathered a lot of information regarding different universities. 

*But when I look around at top blogs, I realized that none of them gave a comparative picture of different universities. I mean we all struggle with the question right, "Why this university?" and that's what we are asked to write in personal statement.*

Hence I took the liberty to deep dive into their websites, look at different offerings. Ranks mentioned at different websites do matter, but to a certain limit. You have to deep dive into the research, curriculum, fees, alumni, research topics, facilities, networking opportunities, housing facilities and so much more while deciding for a university.

Use this blog as a context to that. I have extracted the information that is enough for you to atleast getting started with your search. I have created a simple path / pattern for you to surf around so that you are synced with information in similar structure.

All the information here has been taken from the official websites unless mentioned otherwise.
