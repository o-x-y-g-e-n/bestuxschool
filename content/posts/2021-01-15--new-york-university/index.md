* **ITP Graduate Courses** [🔗](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp/courses/itp-courses)

* **Diversity, Equity & Inclusion** [🔗](https://tisch.nyu.edu/diversity.html)
> While we have always strived for a community upheld by these values, recent conversations with a dedicated group of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and school leaders prove that we have a long way to go. We must do more than witness and stand in solidarity. We must commit to honest and difficult conversations about the structures and practices in our school that support and sustain inequities, and collectively work to dismantle racism by aligning our practices and resources to the values we celebrate: equity and racial justice.
