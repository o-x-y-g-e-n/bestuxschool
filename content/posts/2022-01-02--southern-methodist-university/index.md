## What's special about M.A in Design & Innovation - Southern Methodist University (SMU)
## Designer-in-Residence Program [üîó](https://www.smu.edu/Lyle/Academics/Multidisciplinary-Programs/MADI/Partnerships/Designer-in-Residence-Program)
The Designer-in-Residence program exists to enrich the MADI student experience by engaging with design professionals to bring the most up-to-date working knowledge to the curriculum. We partner with a designer that has skill sets aligned with our studio project each semester, where they come in for critique, guidance, and support. The program emphasizes direct contact with MADI students to broaden student exposure across multiple design disciplines. The Designers-in-Residence have spent approximately 2,400 hours over the last 5 years with our graduate students. We also highlight who they are and what their perspective is on design with a public event each semester.

## SMU Design Council [üîó](https://www.smu.edu/Lyle/Academics/Multidisciplinary-Programs/MADI/Partnerships/SMU-Design-Council)
The SMU Design Council is a forum for leaders who appreciate and acknowledge Human-Centered Design and Innovation as critical strategic elements of their future success. The Design Council along with the Master of Arts in Design and Innovation (MADI) and the Designer-in-Residence, come together to make up the Design and Innovation Programs at SMU.

## MADI Events [üîó](https://blog.smu.edu/madievents/)
Every year we work with our partners to put on timely, thought-provoking, and engaging events as a way to bring together the DFW design community.

### Orientation 
MADI Orientation is one of our most exciting times and dedicated to setting the stage and expectation of what each student‚Äôs graduate experience will be like. We welcome new students to the program by going through all aspects of the program with plenty of getting-to-know-you time! We then get to welcome back returning students so the whole MADI family has the opportunity to connect before classes start. Orientation is also when we reveal our new MADI T-shirts, common read, and Coffee Partners. 

### Coffee Partners
We recognize that not everyone has a class together, and we wanted to create a way to help build
connections across all of MADI, for new and returning students alike. Through our student Coffee
Partners, new students are partnered with existing students and graduating students are partnered with alumni. This has been a great method for connecting students who might not otherwise have a chance to get to know each other and also for keeping alumni engaged in the program.

### Field Trips 
We are always looking for ways to open our academic doors to the professional industry and to get our
students through professional doors in return. One way we create these connections is through field trips to different design firms. These mostly happen within our Context & Impact course, but we love making new and interesting connections whenver possible. Community is a huge part of MADI, and field trips are a way we are able to expand and deepen ours. 

### End-of-Semester Reviews
MADI is a transformational program not only with the work our students create but also on a personal
level. We want to honor the different ways students grow and embody the Human-Centered Design
process by having each student give an End-of-Semester Review. This is a chance students have to reflect and present on who they were at the beginning of the semester and who they are at the end. In turn, hearing each student‚Äôs personal reflection about their time in MADI becomes transformational for the faculty and staff who are at the presentations. This experience helps build presentation skills and also creates a much-deserved space for reflection and application.
