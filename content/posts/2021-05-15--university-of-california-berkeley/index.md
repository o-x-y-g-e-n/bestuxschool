## Personal Statement Prompt
The Statement of Purpose should describe your relevant academic and professional experience and accomplishments, your future professional goals once the degree is acquired, and why you are drawn to the MIMS program and believe it would be a good fit for you and your goals.

The focus should be on your preparation, experience, and aims rather than a discussion of the trends or the importance of information in general. The most successful statements are 1–2 pages in length and focus on the strengths, experiences, and fit of the applicant, providing the admissions committee with evidence and justification for admitting those applicants who are qualified and well-suited for the I School.

## Personal History Statement
n addition to describing how your personal background and experiences have influenced your decision to pursue graduate studies, you may also include any relevant information on the following topics:

* How you have overcome barriers to access higher education
* How you have come to understand the barriers faced by others
* Your academic service to advance equitable access to high education for women, racial minorities, and individuals from other groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education
* Your research focusing on underserved populations or related issues of inequality
* Your leadership among such groups

The Personal History essay, typically `1-2 pages` in length, provides an opportunity for the admissions committee to get to know you better on a personal level, and content should not duplicate what has been shared in the Statement of Purpose. For additional guidance, please review the Graduate Division's [Personal Statement Guide](http://www.grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/personal_statement.shtml).


## Short Answer Essay
The Short Answer Essay should answer the following question in `300 words or less`. Please be sure this essay demonstrates your quantitative, analytical, and problem-solving abilities, as well as your strong writing skills.

> What is the most interesting information problem you have ever solved? Explain why it was interesting and how you solved it.
