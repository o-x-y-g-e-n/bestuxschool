### Personal Statement Prompt 
We ask for a personal statement because we want to get a sense of who you are in your own words beyond what we can infer from your resume/CV. We want to see how your experiences, successes, and failures have shaped how you see the world, what ideas you have and what you want to do. Name an issue or two, big or small, in the world that is important to you. In what way could you address this problem or create awareness about it?  If you could revisit a previous project of yours again, how would you do it differently? You can write about anything that shows us what ideas you have and what you want to do. Don't be afraid to take some chances. Please note that you do not need to address all of the prompts above.

### Diversity, Equity & Inclusion [read more](https://tisch.nyu.edu/diversity.html)
While we have always strived for a community upheld by these values, recent conversations with a dedicated group of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and school leaders prove that we have a long way to go. We must do more than witness and stand in solidarity. We must commit to honest and difficult conversations about the structures and practices in our school that support and sustain inequities, and collectively work to dismantle racism by aligning our practices and resources to the values we celebrate: equity and racial justice.
